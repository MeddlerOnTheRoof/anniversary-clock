# anniversary-clock
A clock that counts up how long I've been with my girlfriend and has a slide of pictures.

# Enhancement Ideas
- integrate with dropbox for retrieving pictures
- swipe left/right touch (arrows with hover highlights on desktop) for moving through pictures
- swipe down (arrow with hover highlight on desktop) for accessing music controls, integrated with pandora
- UWP version for windows
- random text for random days (e.g. 'oh you look great today!')
- shuffle mode for pictures (actually decent randomization without back-to-backs)
- toggle playful and or sexual banter
- input menu for configuration or administrative tasks so the user doesn't have to go into the code
- quick admin menu from swipe up
- double tap to pause music/picture slide
- integrating with something similar to wegupp?
- alternative integration options for different music or picture sources
